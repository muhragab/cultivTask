Cultiv Engineering PHP API Challenge

## The Challenge

Use the technology stack you are comfortable with to design and build an API that does the following:
1. Authenticates users from Mobile app and Website (example: React app).
2. Authorizes following user types:

    - Can CRUD and List users posts
	- User
		- Can edit his/her profile
    - Can CRUD and List their posts
3. Serves
	- Service status
	- Heartbeat
	- API version

### Tests:
- Each endpoint should have its own test

### Bonus:
- Create a GraphQL API instead of RESTful API
